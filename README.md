## User Story


As a user, I would like a tic tac toe game I can play with another user.


## Installation


Do a git fork and clone. In the command line, go to the project directory and type on python and then name of the file.


## Usage

On game launch, the applicaton will randomly choose which player will go first. That player will choose if they want to be X or O. Then the player will choose the space they would like to place their marker by typing in a number between 1-9. Gameboard is based on the standard number keyboard pad. The player that gets three of their marker in a row wins. If there is no winner, the game is a draw.
